<h1 align="center">Accessibility First Software Engineer</h1>
Hey! I am a software engineer who specialises in load speed and accessibility. 

Here are a few things I am up to:

## A11y Monsters
I am "Chief Monster" among the A11y monsters (a community to learn about Accessibility).

We learn about accessibility, WCAG, ATAG, WAI-ARIA and all manner of strange acronyms related to accessibility.

I believe accessibility is the last unsolved problem in tech, and I urge you to join us, no matter where you are in your career (from just starting out to CTO!) to learn more about the wonderful world of accessibility!

[Join the A11y Monsters Discord](https://discord.gg/kKS39R7jjR) or [check out the A11y monsters repo](https://github.com/GrahamTheDevRel/a11y-monsters)

## WCAG 101
I am working on making the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) easier to understand with WCAG 101.

## Tota11y.dev
I really do encourage you to check out me AaaS.

No no, it is not what you think, I mean my company that provides Accessibility as a Service.
